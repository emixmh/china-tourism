## Data Collection

Data was collected from the National Bureau of Statistics of China's (NBS) [English language site](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/).

The NBS data was originally 4 separate CSV files that were imported and combined in Microsoft Excel.

The English titles were cross referenced with the original titles from the Bureau's [Chinese language site](https://data.stats.gov.cn/staticreq.htm). The titles were renamed to be more concise before cleaning in Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Cleaning

All code can be seen in [.ipynb file](china.ipynb).

### 1. Translation Issues

First was to determine what was going on with the domestic tourism yuan values. The English titles were "Tourism Expenditure(100 million yuan)" and " Earnings from Domestic Tourism(100 million yuan)", but both shared the same Chinese title「国内旅游总花费(亿元)」. The Chinese translates to "Total Domestic Tourism Expenditure (100 million yuan)." (All translations can be found in the [.xlsx file](data.xlsx).)

9/20 values were not the same between the two datasets with only a few million yuan difference (a few hundred-thousand USD). Further investigation did not clarify the differences, so both were kept following the English titles.

### 2. Nulls

There were several nulls within the table.

Most null values were for subcategories of international tourists (ie tourists from Hong Kong, Taiwan, single-day entry, etc.[^1]) Those fields had too many nulls and were dropped since there were complete records for the total international tourists count. 

`inbound_tourists_10k` and `intl_tourism_revenue_million_usd` have null values during COVID Lockdown[^2] in China, so these values were replaced with 0.

`travel_agencies` and `star_hotels` have missing values for 2023. They were backwards filled as every other field 2023 values to be analyzed and it marks a whole year after China lifted their COVID restrictions.

### 3. Continuity

The raw data was all in Chinese Yuan (CNY) except for international tourist earnings which was in US Dollars (USD).

Annual currency conversions were taken from [FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AEXCHUS) for all relevant years.

Two tables were made, one with all currency converted to CNY and the other to USD.

The analysis uses currency set to USD.

## Analysis & Insights

## Dataset Info

Note from NBS:
- Population data for 2010 and 2020 are projections from the population census of that year and data for the remaining years are projections from the Annual Population Sample Survey. 
- The growth in per capita disposable income (%) and per capita consumption expenditure (%) are real growth (%) net of price factors, while the rest of the growth (%) is nominal growth (%)
- Median per capita income refers to the per capita income of all surveyed households ranked in order of per capita income level from low to high (or high to low), with the per capita income of the surveyed households in the middle most position
