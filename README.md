- Increase in domestic tourism expenditure.
- Decrease in portion of disposable income used for domestic tourism.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

- Currently, insights can only be attributed to correlation, not causation. Further analysis is needed.

- Collect demographic data of travel agency users: Who're using their services? For what types of domestic travel?
- Look into the reason hotel numbers are declining.
